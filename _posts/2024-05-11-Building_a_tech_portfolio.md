# Introduction

People aspiring to break into tech essentially focus a lot on acquiring knowledge and skills while ignoring the importance of building a tech portfolio along the way. In this blog post, I will share with you three key actionable strategies to build your portfolio. You will also get access to resources to get you started. 

# Three Steps to building a Tech Portfolio
## Step 1: Build in Public
When starting out, you might be tempted to learn privately and let people know that you have gained a particular certification or completed a certain course. Most of the time this works against you because you are unable to validate that your course completion or certification actually translated into skills. Patrick, a fellow community builder calls it the matrix: Knowledge, Skills, and Certifications. If you have only one of either then you are doomed. e.g. If you only have a certification but you have no knowledge and skills to show for it, then it counts for nothing. 
To build in public there are two non-negotiables a Technical Blog and a Projects repository. You may optionally decide to build a portfolio website but I currently find having a professional profile on a platform such as LinkedIn is more than enough. 

ðŸš€ You can start a blog on websites such as [Medium](https://medium.com), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) or [DEV.to](https://dev.to)
âœ¨ When it comes to building repositories of projects as well as contributing to open source we have popular repositories such as [Github](https://github.com) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.com)

## Step 2: Select, join, and be active in a tech community
**Joining any and every community on the internet harms you** more than it helps you, you need to develop discernment to check whether you are actually joining a community or just joining a group of people who have no idea why they are together. A community that has what it takes must meet the following in your checklist:
- [x] Has a clear mission and vision
- [x] Is focused on a particular technology or domain
- [x] Has a supportive leadership, no one man/woman show
- [x] Is active and innovative
- [x] Is non-discriminative and welcome

I know the list is non-exhaustive but those are the bare minimums when selecting a community to join. Once you join, play an active part in growing the community. 

## Step 3: Contribute to Open Source Projects
This is one of the best ways of showing that you have the skills and ensure that your skills are offering something meaningful to the world. There are several Open Source Projects you can contribute to with one of the prominent ones I know being [All in](https://allinopensource.org/) and [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs).
